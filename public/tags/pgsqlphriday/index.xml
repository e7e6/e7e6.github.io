      <description>This week, #PGSQLPhriday is hosted by Alicja Kucharczyk. Every month, one community member proposes a new subject to this monthly blogging event and let the world (or your family/friends/neighbors if you prefer) know all about pgBadger. It&amp;#39;s a tool to analyze your PostgreSQL logs and present you a nice web report.
If you like some history, it has been developed by Gilles Darold since more than 11 years, as v1.</description>

      <description>With Michael of pgMustard fame current host of #PGSQLPhriday, I could not resist revisiting this rather abondoned place of the interweb. As a short prelude, PGSQL Phriday is a blog event to talk of all things PostgreSQL and this week topic is about pg_stat_statements.
pg_stat_statement is a module available since 2009 in Postgres 8.4. It tracks execution statistics on all SQL statements that have been executed. Since version 13, it also tracks planning statistics.</description>
